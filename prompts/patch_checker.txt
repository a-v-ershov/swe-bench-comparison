You need to check 2 git patches.
One is the correct patch to solve the issue and the other was generated by an LLM and we need to check if it is correct.

Issue Description:
~~~
{issue_description}
~~~

Correct patch:
~~~
{correct_patch}
~~~

Generated patch:
~~~
{generated_patch}
~~~

You need to return the result in the JSON format without any additional data.

- correct: true if the generated patch is correct, false otherwise
- description: why do you think the generated patch is correct or not
- files_in_correct_patch: list of files that are changed in the correct patch
- files_in_generated_patch: list of files that are changed in the generated patch

Example of the response:
```json
{{
    "correct": true,
    "description": "Your description",
    "files_in_correct_patch": [
        "path1/file1.py",
        "path2/file2.py",
        ...
    ],
    "files_in_generated_patch": [
        "path1/file1.py",
        "path2/file2.py",
        ...
    ]
}}
